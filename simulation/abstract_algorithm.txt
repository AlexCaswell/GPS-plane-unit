The loop has four steps:

1. Read in data:
	1. gps as latitude_degrees and longitude_degrees
	2. magnetometer as degrees from north (0 to 360)
	3. barometer as feet from initial elevation

2. Check for waypoint arrival
	1. check if current gps coordinates are within the error radius of the current target waypoint loaded from file
	2. If true, set the target waypoint to the next waypoint

3. Calculate error and apply PID gains
	1. calculate height error (target height - current height) and apply corresponding pid gains*
	2. calculate heading error* and apply corresponding pid gains
	3. calculate elevator_turn_gain based on heading error
	4. calculate roll_error based on heading_error and apply corresponding pid gains

4. Apply PID output to actuators



*heading calculations

The compass angle should be a 0 degrees when facing north and with negitive angles to the left.
When the angle from the plane to the wp is calculated it needs to be measured in the same frame, that is with the x-axis pointing north and the y-axis east.
